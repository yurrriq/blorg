[[http://xkcd.com/353/][Hello, world!]] I started working on the [[http://exercism.io/languages/clojure][Clojure exercises]] from [[http://exercism.io/about][exercism.io]].

Feel free to nitpick [[http://exercism.io/yurrriq][my solutions]], and browse the [[https://github.com/yurrriq/exercism/tree/clojure][source on GitHub]].

Maybe this will prove to be a fun way to explore [[https://github.com/yurrriq/exercism/branches/all][different languages]].
