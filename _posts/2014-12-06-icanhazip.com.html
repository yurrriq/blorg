Often, I find myself needing to know the public IP address of a box I'm
hacking on. <a href="http://icanhazip.com">icanhazip.com</a> has become my favorite tool for the task.

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">&#120524; curl icanhazip.com <span style="color: #75715E;"># </span><span style="color: #75715E;">yass, u can</span>
</pre>
</div>

In my experiments it was the fastest, and I've got a penchant for <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/K/KISS-Principle.html">KISS</a>ing.

I made <a href="https://gist.github.com/yurrriq/7fc7634dd00494072f45">a gist</a> with a few backups, just in case.
