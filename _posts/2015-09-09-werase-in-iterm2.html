Using a fresh install of <a href="https://www.iterm2.com">iTerm2</a>, I found that <code>⌥⌫</code> wasn't working as
expected. Within minutes, I noticed a <b>significant</b> decrease in productivity,
since (apparently) I use <code>werase</code> all the time.

Without further ado, here's the time-saving fix I settled on.

Shout out to to <a href="https://manytricks.com/keycodes/">Key Codes</a> (and <a href="http://brew.sh">Homebrew</a>) for making it easy to find the
appropriate hex code.

</pre>
