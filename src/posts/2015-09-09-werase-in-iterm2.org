Using a fresh install of [[https://www.iterm2.com][iTerm2]], I found that =⌥⌫= wasn't working as

since (apparently) I use ~werase~ all the time.

Without further ado, here's the time-saving fix I settled on.

Shout out to to [[https://manytricks.com/keycodes/][Key Codes]] (and [[http://brew.sh][Homebrew]]) for making it easy to find the
appropriate hex code.
