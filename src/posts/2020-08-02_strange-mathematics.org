IN THE EQUATION
XÂ² + MX + N = 0,
M AND N ARE INTEGERS.
THE ONLY POSSIBLE VALUE

VALUE OF M?

SIX.

CORRECT.

But that's not quite right, or at least it's misleading.
While $6$ is a possible value for $m$, it's not the only one.

*Lemma*. Given $x^2 + mx + n = 0$ and $x = -3$,
there are [[https://brilliant.org/wiki/cardinality/][countably infinite]] possible values for $m$ such that
$m,n \in \mathbb{Z}$.

/Proof./
Rewriting the original equation with $x = -3$,
$9 - 3m + n = 0 \leadsto m = \frac{n}{3} + 3$.
It follows that $\forall m \in \mathbb{Z}, \exists n \in 3\mathbb{Z}$ such that
$m = \frac{n}{3} + 3$.
Since $3\mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{Z}$, and
there exists a bijection between $\mathbb{N}$ and $3\mathbb{Z}$, i.e.
$\{1,2,3,4,5,6,...\} \longleftrightarrow \{0,3,-3,6,-6,9,...\}$,
there are $\aleph_{0}$ possible values for $m$.
$\blacksquare$
